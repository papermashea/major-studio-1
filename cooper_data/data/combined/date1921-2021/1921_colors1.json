It was classed then, and still is today, one of the finest printed books on the decorative arts that has ever been published. This work was important in providing accurate depictions of the decoration and ornament of Classical Rome, and those of Italian palaces, churches, and ancient buildings from the 13th through the 16th century. Artists and designers were inspired and influenced by the visual vocabulary of historical styles published by this and other 19th-century pattern books. A number of these publications were often seen as works of art in their own right. The printing and coloring processes were meticulous, time consuming and luxurious. Gr\u00fcner, an artist and engraver, was a confidante of Prince Albert and advised him on questions of art and design. In this capacity, he was closely involved in both the Great Exhibition of 1851 held at the Crystal Palace and, afterwards, in the creation of the South Kensington Museum (which later became the Victoria and Albert Museum). This sumptuous publication catered to the Prince's particular interest in Italian architecture, decoration, and ornament, and established classicism as his preferred style of architecture and design.","label_text":null,"videos":null,"on_display":null,"woe:country":null,"type":"Book Illustration","images":[{"b":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/92749_7dfe084391c53663_b.jpg","width":1024,"height":968,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"92749"},"z":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/92749_7dfe084391c53663_z.jpg","width":640,"height":605,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"92749"},"n":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/92749_7dfe084391c53663_n.jpg","width":320,"height":303,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"92749"},"d":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/92749_7dfe084391c53663_d.gif","width":320,"height":303,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"92749"},"sq":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/92749_7dfe084391c53663_sq.jpg","width":300,"height":300,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"92749"}}],"participants":[{"person_id":"68775569","role_id":"35236661","person_name":"T.

Wealthy Victorian women practiced hair work as part of their leisurely pursuits, often using locks from a deceased friend or relative to create a tangible reminder of that person. Alternatively, hair could be sent to a professional tradesman, but practitioners could be deceitful. Some tradesmen replaced human hair with sturdier horsehair or sold ready-made pieces, disregarding the original strands\u2019 sentimental value. There were two main types of hair work jewelry: hair transformed into a picture and hair plaited into a design. This brooch, which has a matching bracelet in the museum\u2019s collection, displays both styles: the central motif is a horn-of-plenty made of hair, secured in a glass case and surrounded by tightly woven strands. The outer hair would have been plaited around a mold, such as a knitting needle, then boiled and dried before the mold was removed and the piece was taken to a jeweler for a gold clasp and fittings. Hair work jewelry was often based on existing designs, and a form similar to this one is included in Charles T.

Since men had shaved heads or very short hair to accommodate their wigs during this period, they wore caps like this one to keep warm after their wigs were removed. A wig, usually powdered and curled, was standard dress for men of most classes, and it was worn even at the most informal and private events. This lavish nightcap was thus intended for solitary activities, like writing, and only the most intimate guests would have seen it. Some crewel embroidery was produced at home, although professionally embroidered clothing was increasingly common. The exotic flowers and scrolling stems on this cap are frequently found in crewel embroidery. Some imported cotton textiles from India, called chintz, have similar patterns since crewel embroidery influenced the design of many of the chintzes produced for export to England.","label_text":null,"videos":null,"on_display":null,"woe:country":"23424819","type":"Man's cap","images":[{"o":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/44201_9a47fea07af936f7_o.jpg","width":4467,"height":4511,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"44201"},"b":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/44201_5b03cd989cb3b821_b.jpg","width":1014,"height":1024,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"44201"},"z":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/44201_5b03cd989cb3b821_z.jpg","width":634,"height":640,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"44201"},"n":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/44201_5b03cd989cb3b821_n.jpg","width":317,"height":320,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"44201"},"d":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/44201_5b03cd989cb3b821_d.gif","width":317,"height":320,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"44201"},"sq":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/44201_5b03cd989cb3b821_sq.jpg","width":300,"height":300,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"44201"}}],"participants":[{"person_id":"18049939","role_id":"2318792694","person_name":"DeWitt Clinton Cohen","person_date":"","role_name":"Previous owner","role_display_name":"Previously owned by","person_url":"https:\/\/collection.cooperhewitt.org\/people\/18049939\/","role_url":"https:\/\/collection.cooperhewitt.org\/roles\/2318792694\/"},{"person_id":"18051691","role_id":"2318792694","person_name":"Mrs. DeWitt Clinton Cohen","person_date":"","role_name":"Previous owner","role_display_name":"Previously owned by","person_url":"https:\/\/collection.cooperhewitt.org\/people\/18051691\/","role_url":"https:\/\/collection.cooperhewitt.org\/roles\/2318792694\/"},{"person_id":"18049939","role_id":"35351535","person_name":"DeWitt Clinton Cohen","person_date":"","role_name":"Donor","role_display_name":"Donated by","person_url":"https:\/\/collection.cooperhewitt.org\/people\/18049939\/","role_url":"https:\/\/collection.cooperhewitt.org\/roles\/35351535\/"},{"person_id":"18051691","role_id":"35351535","person_name":"Mrs. DeWitt Clinton Cohen","person_date":"","role_name":"Donor","role_display_name":"Donated by","person_url":"https:\/\/collection.cooperhewitt.org\/people\/18051691\/","role_url":"https:\/\/collection.cooperhewitt.org\/roles\/35351535\/"}],"woe:country_name":"France","is_loan_object":0},{"id":"18500185","tms:id":"160994","accession_number":"1979-91-354","title":"Frieze (USA)","title_raw":"","url":"https:\/\/collection.cooperhewitt.org\/objects\/18500185\/","has_no_known_copyright":"1","department_id":"35347503","period_id":null,"media_id":"69156949","type_id":"35259269","date":"1905\u20131915","year_start":1905,"year_end":1915,"year_acquired":"1979","decade":"1900","woe:country_id":"23424977","medium":"machine-printed paper, liquid mica","markings":null,"signed":null,"inscribed":null,"provenance":"None","dimensions":"91 x 49 cm (35 13\/16 x 19 5\/16 in.)","dimensions_raw":{"height":["91.00","centimeters"],"width":["49.00","centimeters"]},"creditline":"Gift of Victorian Collectibles","description":"Vining poppy swag along with vining blue floral swag across center of panel.

In the art and design world, they have been made well-known through the work of artist Yinka Shonibare, who deploys them frequently as a commentary on colonialism. But they remain, for many, a symbol of authentic African-ness. \nThese types of fabrics were originally designed for the Indonesian market, the wax-resist process a mechanized version of batik. The fabrics found a more receptive audience in West Africa, and over time the design and coloration was adapted to this market, although effects unique to the wax process, like crackle and bubbles, are still apparent. The designs are created in the Netherlands through a unique collaborative process with traders\u2014primarily women who run the open-air markets where the fabrics are sold. The traders can get an exclusive on a particular design or colorway, or suggest themes for designs. They also assign names to the designs, which may give them particular local resonance. \nFrom the mid-19th to mid-20th century, Vlisco was one among many competitors in this market, with major centers in Mulhouse, France and Manchester, England. Today the competition comes primarily from China, with printed copies.

Bamboos are twined with vines bearing flowers. From the corners of mound grow flowering trees in branches of which parakeets and squirrels disport themselves. The bamboo trunks are alternately red and brown. Most of flowers in shades of red except for a few large blossoms which are white, with veins of black, but tree trunks at sides are brown and foliage yellow-ish brown with dark brown veins. In upper branches, several large birds in black and brown, identified as babblers, and the parakeets are red, with tails in light and dark brown. In the mound, which is painted in detail in conventionalized paints and curves to suggest hillocks, ar eseveral large blossoms in red, one in browns, and groups of animals (deer?) in red.\r\nThe entire background is painted with a minute feathery pattern of foliage in a light yellowish-brown.  \r\nA border, 17 1\/2 inches wide, in formal design of flower garlands and ribbons, edges the entire quilt, except lower corners, left and right, where it has been cut away to fit a bed. Originally the border was painted in one with the main design, as seen at the bottom, but the cover has been shortened at top, thus clipping off the tips of the bamboos, and cut into at the sides. Where these alterations have taken place the border is sewn by hand to the body of the quilt.\r\nColors: two reds, dark and light brown, pale yellow-brown; remains of light blue in a few large flowers and a few border flowers, black.","justification":null,"gallery_text":null,"label_text":null,"videos":null,"on_display":null,"woe:country":"23424848","type":"Palampore","images":[{"o":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/6824_4de0bf88aaf514f8_o.jpg","width":1008,"height":1501,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"6824"},"b":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/6824_af74e50e182a486e_b.jpg","width":688,"height":1024,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"6824"},"z":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/6824_af74e50e182a486e_z.jpg","width":430,"height":640,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"6824"},"n":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/6824_af74e50e182a486e_n.jpg","width":215,"height":320,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"6824"},"d":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/6824_af74e50e182a486e_d.gif","width":215,"height":320,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"6824"},"sq":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/6824_af74e50e182a486e_sq.jpg","width":300,"height":300,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"6824"}}],"participants":[],"woe:country_name":"India","is_loan_object":0},{"id":"18131125","tms:id":"11709","accession_number":"1902-1-515-a,b","title":"Fragment","title_raw":"","url":"https:\/\/collection.cooperhewitt.org\/objects\/18131125\/","has_no_known_copyright":"1","department_id":"35347501","period_id":null,"media_id":"35402827","type_id":"35254623","date":"16th\u201317th century","year_start":null,"year_end":null,"year_acquired":"1902","decade":null,"woe:country_id":null,"medium":"silk","markings":null,"signed":null,"inscribed":null,"provenance":"ex. coll.

McKnight Kauffer began his commercial arts career as a teenager working as a scene painter for a theater stock company, then as an assistant to a bookseller and art dealer in San Francisco. There, a university professor saw his artistic potential and sent him to Europe to study painting in the 1910s. He eventually settled in London, where he lived until the outbreak of World War II. Incorporating fine-art sensibilities into commercial design\u2014such as for the London Underground\u2014he became one of the country\u2019s most acclaimed poster designers, helping to raise the status of the commercial arts to that of the fine arts. He combined simple, symbolic forms and bold colors with sparse, bold, and straightforward text. Here, silhouettes of women float against a spiral background, possibly inspired by expressionist painting, to encourage traveling by the LUD to shop at winter sales. Despite Kauffer's renown, he was not without critics, including typographers. He refused to adjust letter spacing, sometimes resulting in an uneven composition. As he did in this poster on the lower text lines, he sometimes added a triangle motif at the end of lines to accommodate for the awkward spacing.","label_text":"The tagline\u2014\u201dWinter Sales Are Best Reached by Underground\u201d\u2014was a pitch to increase ridership by reminding savvy female shoppers to take the Underground in stormy weather. Kauffer\u2019s women, bundled in overcoats or obscured by umbrellas, are largely androgynous. Drawing on both 19th-century Japanese prints and cubist abstractions, these silhouetted figures battle against slanting rain, wind, or snow.

A man would use this cap to keep his head warm when he removed his wig, since a wig required short hair or a shaved head. A wig was proper attire for men of almost any status in 18th century France, even during informal social occasions at home. This luxurious nightcap was thus meant for private work and intimate meetings such as the morning toilette, when some elite men received guests while attendants helped him to dress and to curl and powder his wig. The nightcap also appeared in portraits of some artists, writers, and doctors to emphasize the timelessness of their professions. This nightcap was probably custom-made in the growing garment industry, where male tailors oversaw female embroiderers in hierarchical workshops. The symmetrical pattern of flowers and curvaceous stems is worked entirely in expensive metallic thread.

The demand abroad inspired production in France, most notably at Creil, which lends its name to this type of work, as well as at S\u00e8vres. The technique of copper luster work with the yellow dates back to Renaissance Italian and Spanish maiolica; it was very popular in England and the United States in the early to mid-19th century.\nThis example comes to the museum as part of a larger collection of yellow ground ware. The collection represents a broad range of styles, and will greatly expand our ability to tell the history of ceramics and the flow of design influences.","gallery_text":null,"label_text":null,"videos":null,"on_display":null,"woe:country":"23424819","type":"bowl","images":[{"x":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/107379_16a34a9df316ae26_x.jpg","width":4096,"height":3027,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"107379"},"b":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/107379_5b65df2238c88dfb_b.jpg","width":1024,"height":757,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"107379"},"z":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/107379_5b65df2238c88dfb_z.jpg","width":640,"height":473,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"107379"},"n":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/107379_5b65df2238c88dfb_n.jpg","width":320,"height":237,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"107379"},"d":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/107379_5b65df2238c88dfb_d.gif","width":320,"height":237,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"107379"},"sq":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/107379_5b65df2238c88dfb_sq.jpg","width":300,"height":300,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"107379"}},{"x":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/44651_907fd252c1033892_x.jpg","width":4096,"height":4096,"is_primary":"0","image_id":"44651"},"b":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/44651_6054a018a0a774b0_b.jpg","width":1024,"height":1024,"is_primary":"0","image_id":"44651"},"z":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/44651_6054a018a0a774b0_z.jpg","width":640,"height":640,"is_primary":"0","image_id":"44651"},"n":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/44651_6054a018a0a774b0_n.jpg","width":320,"height":320,"is_primary":"0","image_id":"44651"},"d":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/44651_6054a018a0a774b0_d.gif","width":320,"height":320,"is_primary":"0","image_id":"44651"},"sq":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/44651_6054a018a0a774b0_sq.jpg","width":300,"height":300,"is_primary":"0","image_id":"44651"}}],"participants":[{"person_id":"18060143","role_id":"2318792694","person_name":"Jane M.

McKnight Kauffer worked in England from about 1915 to 1940, where he became well-known as a top modern poster designer. He is particularly noted for his more than 150 designs for the London Underground. Kauffer was one of the first designers to apply fine-art principles to advertisements, seeing fine and commercial arts as harmonious rather than distinct. He advocated simplicity in poster design, noting the poster and message had be to seen and understood quickly by a fast-moving pedestrian or car passenger. This poster for a summer sale at Derry & Toms, the London department store, communicates the feeling of summer in a simple, colorful scene of sailboats created through a mix of Japanese woodcut, expressionist, and Fauvist influences. Derry & Toms was one of the most successful companies to follow in the tradition of modernist posters set by Kauffer in the London Underground Railway.

In 1924, he designed his first piece for S\u00e8vres Porcelain Manufactory, and over the next thirty years, he created about 120 more pieces for the company. A versatile designer, Lissom worked not only in elegant tableware, but also in wallpaper, textiles, jewelry, metalwork, graphics, and set and costume design\u2014including projects for the Ballets Russes. Other commissions comprised designs for Martin & Duchet, Limoges, Royal Copenhagen, and Lenox. He maintained the passion for theater and opera instilled in him by his wealthy parents, and paradoxically, his high-end work shows influences of Russia\u2019s colorful folk art. As can be seen on this plate design, he emphasized a harmony of design and form. The abstract design twists inward, embracing the plate\u2019s curve but in an unexpected way and the depiction on the lower right, indicating the backside, suggests the plate would have an all-encompassing design. In 1941, Lissim emigrated to the United States, where he continued to practice design while beginning a career in art education in New York.","label_text":"Lissim was versatile, producing designs for wallpaper, jewelry, textiles, metalwork, graphics, theater design, and ceramics.
