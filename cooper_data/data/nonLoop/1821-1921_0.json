Above, plan describes object\u2019s footprint with dimensions while below at center, a profile view indicates cylindrical rod positioned horizontally in front of supports at bottom and on both sides at top. Additionally, this view shows that supports curl backward toward the wall line at base and frontward at top, just below the console surface.
