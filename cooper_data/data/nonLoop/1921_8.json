The Gazette was a lavish magazine that chronicled contemporary developments in fashion, lifestyle, and beauty. It also advanced fashion illustration to a new level of refinement and sophistication. Each issue featured 10 full-page fashion plates: hand-colored pochoir prints produced by notable artists and illustrators. One such artist, Georges Lepape, was known for his illustration techniques introducing the ideas of \"motion\" and \"story.\" He depicted independent women with carefree attitudes. Lepape became a primary contributor to the Gazette, later working for other well known magazines such as Vogue and Vanity Fair.

Conical vessel resting on a cylindrical stemp, which is attached to a round foot by a transparent glass ball. The body of the goblet is made of clear, colorless glass, layered with air bubbles that form a regular pattern. The foot and lip of the goblet are rimmed in cobalt blue. Three glass disk decorations in blue cobalt are inserted at the top and bottom of the stem. Two small circular handles of blue cobalt glass are attached to the stem.","justification":"These three objects epitomize the best of Bellotto\u2019s personal style as shown at the Mostra delle Arti Decorative di Monza in 1927, characterized by a strong emphasis on geometric forms and reflecting an art deco inspiration. This particular series, called \u201cTrasparente\u201d by Bellotto, features objects with bodies made with transparent glass that is colorless and layered with air bubbles, or greenish without pattern; the objects are accented with contrasting details (such as rims, handles, or applied decorations) in cobalt blue or black glass.  \nGiven the nature of blown glass, the objects would appear to be unique. Similar objects have been documented exhibiting slight variations in color and\/or form, although all vessels from this series draw upon the same design vocabulary. [1] The Corning Museum of Glass owns a double bubble body vase with spiral handles, which seems to be of the same genesis as the one proposed for acquisition. However, the specimen in the Corning collection has inverted proportions, namely a longer stem and a shorter neck, and has spiral handles made of black glass that are attached to the stem, as opposed to the body.[2] \nThe three objects are rare, as Bellotto\u2019s glass-only works were produced during a period of between two to three years. \nBellotto tends to be best known for his works that combine wrought iron and glass, such as the hanging lamp in the collection of the Cooper Hewitt (2012-9-1-a\/j), which represents a very rare and large example of Venetian mosaic glass from the early part of the 20th century.[3] Having the opportunity to augment the collection by adding some of his glass-only works would provide the Cooper Hewitt with the opportunity to add rare and artistically important objects to its collection, as well as to provide additional context for the Bellotto hanging lamp already in the collection.  \nVenetian glass is highly important in the history of glass, from ancient Roman days to the present.  While the museum has a few examples of Venetian glass from the 1950s and 1960s (and a single vase from 1934), it is an area that is appropriate for a much broader scope of holdings. One of the periods of great creativity in Venetian glass \u2013 both technically and artistically \u2013 is the late 19th and early 20th century, a period in which some extraordinarily complex objects were created that probably could not be made today. These three objects are very significant, in and of themselves, and in that context.\n\n\n\n\n[1] In L\u2019arte del vetro: silice e fuoco: vetri del XIX e XX secolo, Rosa Barovier Mentasti refers to a calice dated 1927, which seems identical to the conical glass on stem with circular handles (catalogue 302). Mentasti writes that the calice belongs to a collection that reflects Bellotto\u2019s personal style, which was presented at the Mostra delle Arti Decorative di Monza del 1927, all of which is consistent with the conical glass proposed for acquisition. However, Mentasti describes the handles and rim as being made with black glass, whereas the object under contemplation has cobalt blue glass decorations. The only photograph of the object referred to by Mentasti is in black and white, and so it is unclear whether an error was made in her description, or whether Bellotto would have hand-produced two objects that are identical, but for the color of the decoration. A vase that appears identical to the \u201cdouble-bubble\u201d vase is shown as being on offer by Tillipan \u2013 Fine Decorative Venetian Art Glass. However, only a black and white photograph is available, and the color of the handles is not specified in the catalogue (http:\/\/tillipan.com\/transparente-vase\/umberto_bellotto_5\/) \n[2] Vase with Spiral Handles; ca. 1925; designed by Umberto Bellotto (Italian, 1882-1940); produced by Pauly & C. \u2013 Compagnia Venezia e Murano (1919); glassblowing, hot working; Corning Museum of Glass, 74.3.144.\n[3] Hanging lamp; ca. 1914-1920; made by Vetreria Fratelli Toso and Barovier & Toso and manufactured by Umberto Bellotto; glass, wrought iron, enamel; Gift of Neil and Donna Weisman. 2012-9-1-a\/j. The hanging lantern represents a very rare and large example of Venetian mosaic glass from the early part of the 20th century. Its wrought iron holder, with color-filled incised markings, reflects an interest in dragons and other fantastical creatures that became popular in the 1880s after they appeared in displays of Japanese and Chinese objects at the 1878 Paris World's Fair. This lamp is a complex example of mosaic glass based on techniques created in the second half of the 19th century.","gallery_text":"While Umberto Bellotto\u2019s works typically combined glass with wrought iron, the Transparente Series is a rare example exclusively of glass.

His cloak and cap are cut from geometric patterns, in a modern take on medieval fashion. Boyars were high-ranking aristocrats who advised the princes of medieval Russia, but this one wouldn\u2019t look out of place in a cubist or constructivist painting. In step with these artistic movements, designer Alexandra Exter reduces the traditional, ornate uniform of a boyar into elemental shapes and contours. This innovative costume was likely intended for an avant-garde opera or play. Exter was attracted to the dynamism of theater, and in her many theatrical designs, she sought to capture an actor\u2019s movement in three dimensions. In this drawing, a structured column of cloth extends from the boyar\u2019s torso to his toes.

In the art and design world, they have been made well-known through the work of artist Yinka Shonibare, who deploys them frequently as a commentary on colonialism. But they remain, for many, a symbol of authentic African-ness. \nThese types of fabrics were originally designed for the Indonesian market, the wax-resist process a mechanized version of batik. The fabrics found a more receptive audience in West Africa, and over time the design and coloration was adapted to this market, although effects unique to the wax process, like crackle and bubbles, are still apparent. The designs are created in the Netherlands through a unique collaborative process with traders\u2014primarily women who run the open-air markets where the fabrics are sold. The traders can get an exclusive on a particular design or colorway, or suggest themes for designs. They also assign names to the designs, which may give them particular local resonance. \nFrom the mid-19th to mid-20th century, Vlisco was one among many competitors in this market, with major centers in Mulhouse, France and Manchester, England. Today the competition comes primarily from China, with printed copies.

Her textiles are renowned for their color, their abstract and asymmetrical composition, and their incorporation of new materials.\nSt\u00f6lzl studied at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Munich prior to entering the Bauhaus in 1919. At the Bauhaus, her courses with Paul Klee influenced her bright and lively color palette and the horizontally-aligned compositions used in her woven art of the 1920s and 30s. By 1925, she was appointed craft master of the weaving workshop, which she ran with Georg Muche; she became the workshop master upon Muche\u2019s departure in 1927. Due to mounting political pressure, St\u00f6lzl was asked to step down in 1931. She moved to Zurich where she continued weaving, founding S P H Stoffe with fellow Bauhaus students Gertrude Preiswerk and Heinrich-Otto H\u00fcrlimann. After the departure of H\u00fcrlimann in 1937, she ran the workshop under the name Handweberei Flora (Flora Handweaving Mill). The company existed for 30 years, after which St\u00f6lzl continued weaving independently until her death. \nThis is a wonderful opportunity to acquire work by one of great female Bauhaus designers. This piece, together with another textile design drawing proposed for acquisition, would be the first examples of St\u00f6lzl\u2019s drawings in the museum\u2019s collection.","gallery_text":null,"label_text":null,"videos":null,"on_display":null,"woe:country":"23424829","type":"Drawing","images":[{"b":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/40001_b41917336e9cea06_b.jpg","width":1024,"height":843,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"40001"},"z":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/40001_b41917336e9cea06_z.jpg","width":640,"height":527,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"40001"},"n":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/40001_b41917336e9cea06_n.jpg","width":320,"height":264,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"40001"},"d":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/40001_b41917336e9cea06_d.gif","width":320,"height":264,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"40001"},"sq":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/40001_b41917336e9cea06_sq.jpg","width":300,"height":300,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"40001"}},{"b":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/244779_97d11ae57a99c694_b.jpg","width":851,"height":1024,"is_primary":"0","image_id":"244779"},"z":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/244779_97d11ae57a99c694_z.jpg","width":532,"height":640,"is_primary":"0","image_id":"244779"},"n":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/244779_97d11ae57a99c694_n.jpg","width":266,"height":320,"is_primary":"0","image_id":"244779"},"d":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/244779_97d11ae57a99c694_d.gif","width":266,"height":320,"is_primary":"0","image_id":"244779"},"sq":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/244779_97d11ae57a99c694_sq.jpg","width":300,"height":300,"is_primary":"0","image_id":"244779"}}],"participants":[{"person_id":"18052861","role_id":"35236655","person_name":"Adelgunde (Gunta) St\u00f6lzl","person_date":"German, 1897\u20131983","role_name":"Designer","role_display_name":"Designed by","person_url":"https:\/\/collection.cooperhewitt.org\/people\/18052861\/","role_url":"https:\/\/collection.cooperhewitt.org\/roles\/35236655\/"}],"woe:country_name":"Germany","is_loan_object":0},{"id":"18759389","tms:id":"255980","accession_number":"1968-101-30-25","title":"Paper Doll (USA)","title_raw":"","url":"https:\/\/collection.cooperhewitt.org\/objects\/18759389\/","has_no_known_copyright":"1","department_id":"35347493","period_id":null,"media_id":"1108827469","type_id":"35287733","date":"1922","year_start":1922,"year_end":1922,"year_acquired":"1968","decade":"1920","woe:country_id":"23424977","medium":"brush and oil, graphite on board","markings":null,"signed":null,"inscribed":null,"provenance":"Ms. Stell Andersen, New York;

The lamp has five different points of articulation and is capable of swinging 360 degrees. Buquet manufactured these lamps himself in several different versions: desktop, floor lamp, wall mounted, and this version, which can clamp to an architect\u2019s drawing board. The lamps are made of aluminum and nickel-plated brass, and the freestanding versions feature a weighted wooden base. All of the versions contain counterweights in the articulating arms for stability, regardless of their position.  It is believed that many of the most highly regarded architect and designers of the time owned Buquet\u2019s lamp, including Le Corbusier, Marcel Breuer, and Louis Sognot. The design was exhibited at the Salon d'Automne in Paris in 1929.\n \nThe lamp is a prime example of the emphasis on functional design that emerged in the late 1920s and 1930s. Rooted in the dictum that \u201cform follows function,\u201d functionalism came to be embraced by modernist furniture and product designers as well as architects.  Unlike streamline designers working at the same time, who preferred to shroud the mechanical parts of objects, functionalists believed that there was an inherent beauty to an object\u2019s working parts and that they were best expressed in an open and honest way. This lamp is contemporaneous with George Carwardine\u2019s Anglepoise lamp (1932), and Christian Dell\u2019s articulated lamp designs at the Bauhaus (late 1920s and early 1930s) and therefore reflects greater trends for flexibility as well as an industrial aesthetic in modern lighting design of the period.","gallery_text":null,"label_text":null,"videos":null,"on_display":null,"woe:country":null,"type":"desk lamp","images":[{"b":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/334234_f209e6310819109c_b.jpg","width":1024,"height":952,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"334234"},"z":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/334234_f209e6310819109c_z.jpg","width":640,"height":595,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"334234"},"n":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/334234_f209e6310819109c_n.jpg","width":320,"height":297,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"334234"},"sq":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/334234_f209e6310819109c_sq.jpg","width":300,"height":300,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"334234"}}],"participants":[{"person_id":"839994697","role_id":"35236655","person_name":"Edouard-Wilfred Buquet","person_date":"French, (1886 - ?)","role_name":"Designer","role_display_name":"Designed by","person_url":"https:\/\/collection.cooperhewitt.org\/people\/839994697\/","role_url":"https:\/\/collection.cooperhewitt.org\/roles\/35236655\/"},{"person_id":"823314305","role_id":"35351535","person_name":"David Teiger Trust","person_date":"","role_name":"Donor","role_display_name":"Donated by","person_url":"https:\/\/collection.cooperhewitt.org\/people\/823314305\/","role_url":"https:\/\/collection.cooperhewitt.org\/roles\/35351535\/"}],"is_loan_object":0},{"id":"18385009","tms:id":"102638","accession_number":"1950-66-64","title":"Drawing, Plan and Elevation for Two Family House (Type No. 2)","title_raw":"Plan and Elevation for Two Family House (Type No. 2)","url":"https:\/\/collection.cooperhewitt.org\/objects\/18385009\/","has_no_known_copyright":"1","department_id":"35347493","period_id":null,"media_id":"35376289","type_id":"35237093","date":"ca. 1921","year_start":1921,"year_end":1921,"year_acquired":"1950","decade":"1920","woe:country_id":null,"medium":"pen and black ink, graphite on tracing paper","markings":null,"signed":null,"inscribed":"Inscribed at top in black ink: MAISON-- 2 LOGEMENTS DE 4 PIECES A\/ TYPE NO. 2\r\nInscribed at bottom in black ink: FACADE PRINCIPALE","provenance":"Gift of Madame Hector Guimard","dimensions":"30.8 x 49.2 cm (12 1\/8 x 19 3\/8 in.)","dimensions_raw":{"height":["30.80","centimeters"],"width":["49.20","centimeters"]},"creditline":"Gift of Mme.

McKnight Kauffer began his commercial arts career as a teenager working as a scene painter for a theater stock company, then as an assistant to a bookseller and art dealer in San Francisco. There, a university professor saw his artistic potential and sent him to Europe to study painting in the 1910s. He eventually settled in London, where he lived until the outbreak of World War II. Incorporating fine-art sensibilities into commercial design\u2014such as for the London Underground\u2014he became one of the country\u2019s most acclaimed poster designers, helping to raise the status of the commercial arts to that of the fine arts. He combined simple, symbolic forms and bold colors with sparse, bold, and straightforward text. Here, silhouettes of women float against a spiral background, possibly inspired by expressionist painting, to encourage traveling by the LUD to shop at winter sales. Despite Kauffer's renown, he was not without critics, including typographers. He refused to adjust letter spacing, sometimes resulting in an uneven composition. As he did in this poster on the lower text lines, he sometimes added a triangle motif at the end of lines to accommodate for the awkward spacing.","label_text":"The tagline\u2014\u201dWinter Sales Are Best Reached by Underground\u201d\u2014was a pitch to increase ridership by reminding savvy female shoppers to take the Underground in stormy weather. Kauffer\u2019s women, bundled in overcoats or obscured by umbrellas, are largely androgynous. Drawing on both 19th-century Japanese prints and cubist abstractions, these silhouetted figures battle against slanting rain, wind, or snow.

The body of the vase is made of transparent green blown glass. It consists of a double bubble body, cinched at the waist, on top of which rests a long, narrow neck that flares into a disk. The body rests on a large circular foot. Things of black, opaque glass ornament the neck and waist of the vessel, while the top lip and foot are rimmed in black. Two large spiral handles of green transparent glass are attached to the body of the vessel.","justification":"These three objects epitomize the best of Bellotto\u2019s personal style as shown at the Mostra delle Arti Decorative di Monza in 1927, characterized by a strong emphasis on geometric forms and reflecting an art deco inspiration. This particular series, called \u201cTrasparente\u201d by Bellotto, features objects with bodies made with transparent glass that is colorless and layered with air bubbles, or greenish without pattern; the objects are accented with contrasting details (such as rims, handles, or applied decorations) in cobalt blue or black glass.  \nGiven the nature of blown glass, the objects would appear to be unique. Similar objects have been documented exhibiting slight variations in color and\/or form, although all vessels from this series draw upon the same design vocabulary. [1] The Corning Museum of Glass owns a double bubble body vase with spiral handles, which seems to be of the same genesis as the one proposed for acquisition. However, the specimen in the Corning collection has inverted proportions, namely a longer stem and a shorter neck, and has spiral handles made of black glass that are attached to the stem, as opposed to the body.[2] \nThe three objects are rare, as Bellotto\u2019s glass-only works were produced during a period of between two to three years. \nBellotto tends to be best known for his works that combine wrought iron and glass, such as the hanging lamp in the collection of the Cooper Hewitt (2012-9-1-a\/j), which represents a very rare and large example of Venetian mosaic glass from the early part of the 20th century.[3] Having the opportunity to augment the collection by adding some of his glass-only works would provide the Cooper Hewitt with the opportunity to add rare and artistically important objects to its collection, as well as to provide additional context for the Bellotto hanging lamp already in the collection.  \nVenetian glass is highly important in the history of glass, from ancient Roman days to the present.  While the museum has a few examples of Venetian glass from the 1950s and 1960s (and a single vase from 1934), it is an area that is appropriate for a much broader scope of holdings. One of the periods of great creativity in Venetian glass \u2013 both technically and artistically \u2013 is the late 19th and early 20th century, a period in which some extraordinarily complex objects were created that probably could not be made today. These three objects are very significant, in and of themselves, and in that context.\n\n\n\n\n[1] In L\u2019arte del vetro: silice e fuoco: vetri del XIX e XX secolo, Rosa Barovier Mentasti refers to a calice dated 1927, which seems identical to the conical glass on stem with circular handles (catalogue 302). Mentasti writes that the calice belongs to a collection that reflects Bellotto\u2019s personal style, which was presented at the Mostra delle Arti Decorative di Monza del 1927, all of which is consistent with the conical glass proposed for acquisition. However, Mentasti describes the handles and rim as being made with black glass, whereas the object under contemplation has cobalt blue glass decorations. The only photograph of the object referred to by Mentasti is in black and white, and so it is unclear whether an error was made in her description, or whether Bellotto would have hand-produced two objects that are identical, but for the color of the decoration. A vase that appears identical to the \u201cdouble-bubble\u201d vase is shown as being on offer by Tillipan \u2013 Fine Decorative Venetian Art Glass. However, only a black and white photograph is available, and the color of the handles is not specified in the catalogue (http:\/\/tillipan.com\/transparente-vase\/umberto_bellotto_5\/) \n[2] Vase with Spiral Handles; ca. 1925; designed by Umberto Bellotto (Italian, 1882-1940); produced by Pauly & C. \u2013 Compagnia Venezia e Murano (1919); glassblowing, hot working; Corning Museum of Glass, 74.3.144.\n[3] Hanging lamp; ca. 1914-1920; made by Vetreria Fratelli Toso and Barovier & Toso and manufactured by Umberto Bellotto; glass, wrought iron, enamel; Gift of Neil and Donna Weisman. 2012-9-1-a\/j. The hanging lantern represents a very rare and large example of Venetian mosaic glass from the early part of the 20th century. Its wrought iron holder, with color-filled incised markings, reflects an interest in dragons and other fantastical creatures that became popular in the 1880s after they appeared in displays of Japanese and Chinese objects at the 1878 Paris World's Fair. This lamp is a complex example of mosaic glass based on techniques created in the second half of the 19th century.","gallery_text":"While Umberto Bellotto\u2019s works typically combined glass with wrought iron, the Transparente Series is a rare example exclusively of glass.

When Kauffer arrived in England in the mid-1910s as a painter, he became involved in avant-garde artists' groups. Finding success in posters\u2014and seeing no status differentiation between fine and commercial arts\u2014he decided to give up painting for advertising design. He received his first poster commission in 1915 from Frank Pick, London Underground Electric Railways\u2019 publicity manager, who helped to bring a progressive, modernist image to the Underground. Kauffer eventually designed around 150 posters and car-cards for the Underground. Each poster design typically had a 1,000-issue print run, 150 of which were reserved for selling to individuals, schools, and businesses, who used the modern designs as wall decoration. Kauffer\u2019s posters were widely praised, and he helped to forge a renaissance of British poster design during the interwar period, employing in his designs fine-arts styles from Cubism to expressionism. He promoted simple, geometric designs that attracted attention, as shown in this abstract depiction of the jagged, metallic mineral stibnites that could likely be found at the advertised London Museum of Practical Geology. As was typical of Kauffer, he used a symbolic form rather than a realistic depiction or shocking image to promote a place or product.","label_text":"A new series promoting easy access by Underground to London museums featured objects that Kauffer selected from the institutions\u2019 collections. For the first poster, advertising a geology museum, Kauffer illustrated a massive angular stibnite. The Underground received so many inquiries from a baffled public that it was necessary to issue a definition of the mineral formation. For each poster in the series, Kauffer tried out a different stylistic approach. The designs sparked debate in the press for their varied uses of abstraction.

A Lesson in Reticella Lace not only speaks to homemaking but, with the lovely intricacies of the lace, connects the art of needlework with beautifying the home and creating fashionable attire for the family.","label_text":null,"videos":null,"on_display":null,"woe:country":null,"type":"Magazine page","images":[{"b":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/91708_d3a2fbc0740df7fd_b.jpg","width":785,"height":1024,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"91708"},"z":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/91708_d3a2fbc0740df7fd_z.jpg","width":490,"height":640,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"91708"},"n":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/91708_d3a2fbc0740df7fd_n.jpg","width":245,"height":320,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"91708"},"d":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/91708_d3a2fbc0740df7fd_d.gif","width":245,"height":320,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"91708"},"sq":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/91708_d3a2fbc0740df7fd_sq.jpg","width":300,"height":300,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"91708"}}],"participants":[{"person_id":"68775577","role_id":"35236661","person_name":"The Priscilla Publishing Company","person_date":"Boston, Massachusetts, USA","role_name":"Publisher","role_display_name":"Published by","person_url":"https:\/\/collection.cooperhewitt.org\/people\/68775577\/","role_url":"https:\/\/collection.cooperhewitt.org\/roles\/35236661\/"}],"is_loan_object":0},{"id":"68776041","tms:id":"278371","accession_number":"SIL39088012891669_2","title":"Magazine Page, The Modern Priscilla, vol. 35, no. 7; Kleinert\u2019s Gem Dress Shields","title_raw":"The Modern Priscilla, vol. 35, no. 7; Kleinert\u2019s Gem Dress Shields","url":"https:\/\/collection.cooperhewitt.org\/objects\/68776041\/","has_no_known_copyright":"1","department_id":"68766949","period_id":null,"media_id":"35423833","type_id":"35298977","date":"September 1921","year_start":1921,"year_end":1921,"year_acquired":null,"decade":"1920","woe:country_id":null,"medium":"offset lithography on paper","markings":null,"signed":null,"inscribed":null,"provenance":null,"dimensions":"H x W: 36 \u00d7 25.5 cm (14 3\/16 \u00d7 10 1\/16 in.)","dimensions_raw":null,"creditline":"Collection of Smithsonian Institution Libraries","description":"fTT500.M692","justification":null,"gallery_text":"The number of women purchasing women\u2019s magazines soared in the first decades of the 20th century. Modern Priscilla was one of many publications specifically targeting women that exploded on the scene at a time when women were increasingly being identified as the major consumer group in American society. These magazines were profit-driven businesses that had to satisfy two key customers: the advertisers who purchased space in the publication and the readers who bought the finished product. Advertisements for beauty products, personal hygiene, and fashion accessories were presented alongside ads for household goods and magazine features on cooking, housekeeping, needlework, home decorating, short stories, and fashion and beauty tips. To be a modern woman and homemaker meant buying these products and following the societal dictates of fashion and grooming.

His most influential and important contribution to Modernism was the founding of the Bauhaus school in 1919 in Weimar. The result of a merger between the Grand Ducal School of Arts and Crafts and the Weimar Academy of Fine Art, the Bauhaus implemented a progressive curriculum based on a primary, interdisciplinary course, Vorkurs, and leading to practical workshop courses. The Bauhaus sought to breakdown the binary between fine and applied arts, to marry craft with technology, and to educate designers to work across disciplines and to innovate through collaboration. In 1925, the Bauhaus moved from its original building in Weimar, designed by the Belgian Henry Van de Velde for the School of Arts and Crafts, to a new facility in Dessau designed by Gropius himself. It was for the Bauhaus Dessau that Gropius designed this door handle. The handle marries form and function through pure geometry and an overall industrial aesthetic, exemplifying the New Objectivity that Gropius embraced. The door handle was originally produced by the manufacturer S.A. Loevy in Berlin and, in 1983, went back into production under license to the German firm Tecnoline, a testament to the power and longevity of the handles and the man who designed them.","gallery_text":"Walter Gropius founded the Bauhaus school in 1919 - a merger between the Grand Ducal School of Arts and Crafts and the Weimar Academy of Fine Art.
