The bottom of the panel is edged with a stylized vegetal scalloped border, and the top with a festooned garland of leaves, flowers and bows. Groupings of four fleur-de-lis icons fill the space between medallions, and an allover pattern of trefoils adds texture. This design is printed in tones of red, green and tan on a beige background."

The elevation consists of a cornice with a variety of molding styles, and a frieze of winged cherubs' heads connected by green festoons.  The field of the frieze is periwinkle blue, while the halos behind the cherubs are golden yello, and the festoons are green.  Below this are two niches containing figures.  Each niche is framed by Corinthian pilasters.  The figure at left is a woman wears sandals and a reddish-brown gown with a green robe draped over it.  She has golden red hair and a halo behind her. She holds a book in her left hand and a covered cup in her right.  The figure at right is a man who stands contrapposto with his chest bare and only a gray cloth around his waist.  He holds a tall crucifix in his left hand and with his right gestures to a chalice on the ground at his feet.  Each niche has a scalloped detail behind the heads of the figures.  The niches have considerable depth.  The pilasters framing them are detailed on both sides and turned so that the corner of the support faces front.  The base they stand on has two leafy moldings on either side of a stepped meander frieze in gold and blue.  To the right of this is a measured sketch giving the dimensions that correspond to each architectural level of the sculptural scene."

On the second page explanatory letter by Schinkel dated Febr. 16, 1812.  Explanation of drawing (in transl.): From the gilt rim of each disc a, b, c, d hangs a fringe of glass prisms which diminish in their size in the upper tiers.  A, b, c, d: circular discs, mirror-glass covered, and with a fine and narrow gold edging.  On these stand the various glass objects which--through the reflection of the mirrors--appear double and so to speak will seem to be swinging between the outer borders.  If the reverse of each of the discs would also be covered with mirror-glass, the effect of the mirror, placed back to back, would still be more striking.  The octagonal center column consists also of mirror-glass panels joined at the corners by very narrow gold bands.  Thus, the whole will have an appearance of extreme lightness and transparency which will be in complete harmony with the crystal object standing on it.  The whole composition will rest upon a golden foot (gilt) composed of leaves and lion's claws.  On the top disc stands a bronze candelabra, such as can be found already at Werner and Muth.  The gold ornaments are of gilded wood, and also the foot is made of wood, carved and gilded."

Above left  is the Hospital of Hoorn, a tall masonry building with its fa\u00e7ade articulated by five levels with stepped ends and scrolling ornament.  The window and entrance openings at the ground level are defined by quoins.  There is a Palladian window at the center above the entrance flanked by single round-arched windows on either side.  There are four smaller quare shuttered openings; the one at the building's far left has a small lantern projecting from a bracket.  The window scheme of the upper stories is similar but a triangular pediment is substituted over the windows.  The building bears a date plaque of 1563.  To the building's far right is a smaller, simpler three-story building bearing a date plaque of 1723."

The tower's fa\u00e7ade is articulated by three tall lancet window openings with louvers (possibly containing a bell within).  A small arcaded tracery balustrade is below.  Above the lancets is a broken pediment that projects upward, surmounted by ball finials at the three corners of the pediment.  At right is another finial; at left, a short masonry element supporting a flag.   This story has a small gallery that projects forward.  Beneath these projections are tall, slender masonry supports creating an openwork lancet.  The drawing on the lower half of the sheet is a detailed sketch of a Baroque doorway.  The doors are framed by an arch with quoins and doric columns supporting a thick cornice. Above each column is a lion facing the other.  The fa\u00e7ade continues behind them: a broken pediment is raised up ending in a semicircular cap.  Large c-scrolls at either side further define the imposing pediment.  Behind this is the continuation of a wall with a gallery at right."

Bamboos are twined with vines bearing flowers. From the corners of mound grow flowering trees in branches of which parakeets and squirrels disport themselves. The bamboo trunks are alternately red and brown. Most of flowers in shades of red except for a few large blossoms which are white, with veins of black, but tree trunks at sides are brown and foliage yellow-ish brown with dark brown veins. In upper branches, several large birds in black and brown, identified as babblers, and the parakeets are red, with tails in light and dark brown. In the mound, which is painted in detail in conventionalized paints and curves to suggest hillocks, ar eseveral large blossoms in red, one in browns, and groups of animals (deer?) in red.\r\nThe entire background is painted with a minute feathery pattern of foliage in a light yellowish-brown.  \r\nA border, 17 1/2 inches wide, in formal design of flower garlands and ribbons, edges the entire quilt, except lower corners, left and right, where it has been cut away to fit a bed. Originally the border was painted in one with the main design, as seen at the bottom, but the cover has been shortened at top, thus clipping off the tips of the bamboos, and cut into at the sides. Where these alterations have taken place the border is sewn by hand to the body of the quilt.\r\nColors: two reds, dark and light brown, pale yellow-brown; remains of light blue in a few large flowers and a few border flowers, black."

The circular room is decorated by Manoel da Costa with episodes from the story of Don Quixote. Da Costa was influenced by the French Rococo designer, Jean Pillement.  A rendering of Apollo and the Muses is partially seen on the ceiling.  The bed is draped in the French style; however, the rest of the furniture appears to be English.  The radiating patterned floor is probably of Brazilian hardwood."

The circular room is decorated by Manoel da Costa with episodes from the story of Don Quixote. Da Costa was influenced by the French Rococo designer, Jean Pillement.  A rendering of Apollo and the Muses is partially seen on the ceiling.  The bed is draped in the French style; however, the rest of the furniture appears to be English.
