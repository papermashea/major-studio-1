McKnight Kauffer worked in England from about 1915 to 1940, where he became well-known as a top modern poster designer. He is particularly noted for his more than 150 designs for the London Underground. Kauffer was one of the first designers to apply fine-art principles to advertisements, seeing fine and commercial arts as harmonious rather than distinct. He advocated simplicity in poster design, noting the poster and message had be to seen and understood quickly by a fast-moving pedestrian or car passenger. This poster for a summer sale at Derry & Toms, the London department store, communicates the feeling of summer in a simple, colorful scene of sailboats created through a mix of Japanese woodcut, expressionist, and Fauvist influences. Derry & Toms was one of the most successful companies to follow in the tradition of modernist posters set by Kauffer in the London Underground Railway.

Since men had shaved heads or very short hair to accommodate their wigs during this period, they wore caps like this one to keep warm after their wigs were removed. A wig, usually powdered and curled, was standard dress for men of most classes, and it was worn even at the most informal and private events. This lavish nightcap was thus intended for solitary activities, like writing, and only the most intimate guests would have seen it. Some crewel embroidery was produced at home, although professionally embroidered clothing was increasingly common. The exotic flowers and scrolling stems on this cap are frequently found in crewel embroidery. Some imported cotton textiles from India, called chintz, have similar patterns since crewel embroidery influenced the design of many of the chintzes produced for export to England.","label_text":null,"videos":null,"on_display":null,"woe:country":"23424819","type":"Man's cap","images":[{"o":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/44201_9a47fea07af936f7_o.jpg","width":4467,"height":4511,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"44201"},"b":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/44201_5b03cd989cb3b821_b.jpg","width":1014,"height":1024,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"44201"},"z":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/44201_5b03cd989cb3b821_z.jpg","width":634,"height":640,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"44201"},"n":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/44201_5b03cd989cb3b821_n.jpg","width":317,"height":320,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"44201"},"d":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/44201_5b03cd989cb3b821_d.gif","width":317,"height":320,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"44201"},"sq":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/44201_5b03cd989cb3b821_sq.jpg","width":300,"height":300,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"44201"}}],"participants":[{"person_id":"18049939","role_id":"2318792694","person_name":"DeWitt Clinton Cohen","person_date":"","role_name":"Previous owner","role_display_name":"Previously owned by","person_url":"https:\/\/collection.cooperhewitt.org\/people\/18049939\/","role_url":"https:\/\/collection.cooperhewitt.org\/roles\/2318792694\/"},{"person_id":"18051691","role_id":"2318792694","person_name":"Mrs. DeWitt Clinton Cohen","person_date":"","role_name":"Previous owner","role_display_name":"Previously owned by","person_url":"https:\/\/collection.cooperhewitt.org\/people\/18051691\/","role_url":"https:\/\/collection.cooperhewitt.org\/roles\/2318792694\/"},{"person_id":"18049939","role_id":"35351535","person_name":"DeWitt Clinton Cohen","person_date":"","role_name":"Donor","role_display_name":"Donated by","person_url":"https:\/\/collection.cooperhewitt.org\/people\/18049939\/","role_url":"https:\/\/collection.cooperhewitt.org\/roles\/35351535\/"},{"person_id":"18051691","role_id":"35351535","person_name":"Mrs. DeWitt Clinton Cohen","person_date":"","role_name":"Donor","role_display_name":"Donated by","person_url":"https:\/\/collection.cooperhewitt.org\/people\/18051691\/","role_url":"https:\/\/collection.cooperhewitt.org\/roles\/35351535\/"}],"woe:country_name":"France","is_loan_object":0},{"id":"18482905","tms:id":"152314","accession_number":"1974-20-9","title":"Border (USA)","title_raw":"","url":"https:\/\/collection.cooperhewitt.org\/objects\/18482905\/","has_no_known_copyright":null,"department_id":"35347503","period_id":null,"media_id":"35406007","type_id":"35237285","date":"1879\u201387","year_start":null,"year_end":null,"year_acquired":"1974","decade":null,"woe:country_id":"23424977","medium":"machine-printed paper","markings":null,"signed":null,"inscribed":null,"provenance":"Group of 9 wallpaper samples, ends of rolls found in abandoned garage in Jersey City, NJ.","dimensions":"51 x 51 cm (20 1\/16 x 20 1\/16 in.)","dimensions_raw":{"height":["51.00","centimeters"],"width":["51.00","centimeters"]},"creditline":"Gift of Thomas Golodik","description":"Variety of flowers and wheat shafts forming wavy central band, between narrow band of twisted ribbon.

Open spout and rimmed with metallic purple.","justification":"This pitcher is an example of yellow ground ware, which was produced by Spode and other English factories and exported to continental Europe starting in the late 18th century. The demand abroad inspired production in France, most notably at Creil, which lends its name to this type of work, as well as at S\u00e8vres. \nThis example comes to the museum as part of a larger collection of yellow ground ware. The collection represents a broad range of styles, and will greatly expand our ability to tell the history of ceramics and the flow of design influences.","gallery_text":null,"label_text":null,"videos":null,"on_display":null,"woe:country":"23424975","type":"Pitcher","images":[{"x":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/106929_013658bf02c27cc1_x.jpg","width":3744,"height":3369,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"106929"},"b":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/106929_15cafc887f63d049_b.jpg","width":1024,"height":922,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"106929"},"z":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/106929_15cafc887f63d049_z.jpg","width":640,"height":576,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"106929"},"n":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/106929_15cafc887f63d049_n.jpg","width":320,"height":288,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"106929"},"d":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/106929_15cafc887f63d049_d.gif","width":320,"height":288,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"106929"},"sq":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/106929_15cafc887f63d049_sq.jpg","width":300,"height":300,"is_primary":"1","image_id":"106929"}},{"x":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/44654_16afd2ad45eebda2_x.jpg","width":4096,"height":4096,"is_primary":"0","image_id":"44654"},"b":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/44654_a29ae6afdbf19e49_b.jpg","width":1024,"height":1024,"is_primary":"0","image_id":"44654"},"z":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/44654_a29ae6afdbf19e49_z.jpg","width":640,"height":640,"is_primary":"0","image_id":"44654"},"n":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/44654_a29ae6afdbf19e49_n.jpg","width":320,"height":320,"is_primary":"0","image_id":"44654"},"d":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/44654_a29ae6afdbf19e49_d.gif","width":320,"height":320,"is_primary":"0","image_id":"44654"},"sq":{"url":"https:\/\/images.collection.cooperhewitt.org\/44654_a29ae6afdbf19e49_sq.jpg","width":300,"height":300,"is_primary":"0","image_id":"44654"}}],"participants":[{"person_id":"18060143","role_id":"2318792694","person_name":"Jane M.

A man would use this cap to keep his head warm when he removed his wig, since a wig required short hair or a shaved head. A wig was proper attire for men of almost any status in 18th century France, even during informal social occasions at home. This luxurious nightcap was thus meant for private work and intimate meetings such as the morning toilette, when some elite men received guests while attendants helped him to dress and to curl and powder his wig. The nightcap also appeared in portraits of some artists, writers, and doctors to emphasize the timelessness of their professions. This nightcap was probably custom-made in the growing garment industry, where male tailors oversaw female embroiderers in hierarchical workshops. The symmetrical pattern of flowers and curvaceous stems is worked entirely in expensive metallic thread.
