    "description": "This frieze features curvilinear shields centered between acanthus leaves and filled with a bouquet of roses and horizontal striping. A stylized, green rose vine weaves around the shields borders and turns into a festooned garland that follows a scalloped border at the bottom of the panel. Bouquets of roses alternate horizontally with the acanthus shields. An undulating pattern of c and s scrolls hung with more garlands forms the top border of the panel. This design is printed in shades of brown, dark red, tan and green on a beige ground.",

An artillery shell bursts in the air at her right behind her. Printed in black, diagonally, across the center of the poster, overlapping with the stretcher: Hold up your end! A large red cross appears directly underneath in the center of the stretcher. Printed in smaller black text, below the cross: WAR FUND WEEK / One Hundred Million Dollars.",
